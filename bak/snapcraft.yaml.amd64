summary: An educational math game for kids. # 79 char long summary
description: |
  In "Tux, of Math Command," you play the part of Commander Tux, as he
  defends his friends from an attack of math equations. Comets are
  crashing towards the friendly penguins in their igloos, and you must
  destroy the comets by solving their equations.

  As of version 1.7.0, TuxMath also includes a completely new game
  activity, "Factoroids", which gives practice in factoring numbers and
  simplifying fractions, as well as zapping rocks floating through
  space.
